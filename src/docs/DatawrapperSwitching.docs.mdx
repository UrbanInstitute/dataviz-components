# Datawrapper Switching

It's useful to switch between Datawrapper iframes. Below, we demonstrate two use cases: switching with a dropdown and switching with buttons.

### Switching with a dropdown

<Canvas of={stories.Dropdown} sourceState="shown" />

### Switching with buttons

<Canvas of={stories.Buttons} sourceState="shown" />

### Switching with buttons (and loading wrapper)

<Canvas of={stories.Loading} sourceState="shown" />
