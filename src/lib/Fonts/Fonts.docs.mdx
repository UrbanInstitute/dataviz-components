# Font loading

[![github](https://badgen.net/badge/icon/GitHub?icon=github&label)](https://github.com/UrbanInstitute/dataviz-components/tree/b02e4223ae34b4d0c5d4e2b0ef30bde606801806/src/lib/Fonts)

If you need to load the Urban brand fonts in your SvelteKit-powered project, you can use the font components included in this library.

Import and use either `<FontsUrban />` or `<FontsWorkrise />` to add the necessary markup to the `<head>` of you html like so:

```svelte
<script>
  import { FontsUrban } from "@urbaninstitute/dataviz-components/fonts";
</script>

<FontsUrban />
```

Note: these components take advantage of [Svelte's built-in `<svelte:head>` component](https://svelte.dev/docs/special-elements#svelte-head) to include the markup in the correct place. If you aren't using SvelteKit or some form of server-side rendering, you may want to add these fonts to your project with a more traditional method.
