# SVGMap

A basic map component that can render GeoJSON features as SVG elements. It supports 3 layer types: Polygons, Points or Labels.

This component is useful for simple, thematic maps, especially choropleths. When you need just a bit more control than a no-code solution might provide, you might find this useful. 

## Basic usage

Import the component and the layers you'll need. Load in some GeoJSON - however you want to load it is up to you. Either you can pre-project your GeoJSON data, or you can load a d3-compatable projection function of your choice and pass it to the map component. Finally, set up some layers, providing any additional data and properties.

```javascript
import { SVGMap, PolygonLayer } from "@urbaninstitute/dataviz-components";
```

## Component props

`SVGMap` supports the following props.

<Controls />

## Simple map example

The simplest way to create a map is to load some pre-projected GeoJSON data. For instance, to create a US state map, load the data in your page or component like this:

```javascript
import states from "./path/to/geojson/states.json";
```

And then render your data into a map like this:

<Canvas of={Stories.SimpleMap} sourceState="shown"/>

## Loading topojson, custom projections, custom color scales

It is sometimes tricky to correctly pre-project GeoJSON data for usage with D3. You may find that it is easiest to load an "unprojected" data file (IE: data that has been projected into `WGS84`) and make use of a D3 projection to dynamically project your data client-side. Additionally, using topojson may improve loading time, simplification options and help avoid issues like [winding order](https://observablehq.com/@d3/winding-order) when working with raw GeoJSON data. 

If you're loading topojson data, you should make use of the `topojson-client` package to convert the data back to GeoJSON before passing it into this component. As an example, loading several datasets for a US county choropleth map might look something like this:

```javascript
// import topojson library
import topojson from "topojson-client";

// import prepared topojson data
import county_air_quality_topo from "../path/to/topojson/county_air_quality_topo.json";
import us_cities from "./path/to/topojson/us_cities.json";

// convert topojson back to GeoJSON
const county_air_quality = topojson.feature(county_air_quality_topo, "county_air_quality_geo");
const us_cities_geo = topojson.feature(us_cities, "us_cities");
```

Next, you'll want to import the D3 projection you'd like to use. For this example we'll use `AlbersUSA`, which is a good choice for national-extent US data.

```javascript
import { geoAlbersUSA } from "d3-geo";
```

Finally, in order to create a custom color scale, you can use D3's built in scale functions. First, import the scale you'd like to use, then create a scale based on your color palette and input data. For this example we'll use this library's `urbanColors` utility module.

```javascript
// import scale
import { scaleQuantile } from "d3-scale";
// import color palette utility
import { urbanColors } from "@urbaninstitute/dataviz-components";

// create a scale for the map
let airQualityScale = scaleQuantile()
  .domain(county_air_quality.features.map((d) => d.properties.index_air_quality))
  .range(urbanColors.getDivergingColors());
```

Putting these all together, you can render your map like this:

<Canvas of={Stories.ZoomableCountyChoropleth} sourceState="shown"/>

## Zoomable maps and limiting labels to higher zoom

Maps can include zoom and pan functionality out of the box by passing the `zoomable` prop to the `SVGMap`. Some times you may want to limit the visibility of a `LabelLayer` to a minumum zoom multiplyer. Consider this example of mapping average household income in New York City at the census tract level. You may want to display labels if the user has zoomed in far enough, but hide them when zoomed out to avoid overlapping text.

Loading the data for this map would look something like this:

```javascript
// import topojson library
import topojson from "topojson-client";

// load prepared topojson
import nyc_income_topo from "./path/to/topojson/nyc_income_topo.json";
import nyc_ntas from "./path/to/topojson/nyc_ntas.json";

// load color utility to create a custom scale
import { urbanColors } from "$lib/utils";

// use Mercator projection for this map
import { geoMercator } from "d3-geo";

// Import a D3 scale function
import { scaleQuantize } from "d3-scale";
// Import the extent utility from d3-array to compute the scale
import { extent } from "d3-array";
const nyc_income = topojson.feature(nyc_income_topo, "nyc_income_geo1");
const nyc_neighborhoods = topojson.feature(nyc_ntas, "nyc_ntas");

const incomeScale = scaleQuantize()
  .domain(extent(nyc_income.features, (d) => d.properties.estimate))
  .range(urbanColors.getGreens());
```

At this point, you're ready to render a map like this:

<Canvas of={Stories.LabelsWithMinZoom} sourceState="shown" />

## Setting a highlighted feature

Sometimes you'll need to set a specific feature to a highlighted state based on some external state in your application. In order to do this, you can pass a function to the prop `highlightFeature`. This function will be called with each `feature` in the layer, and if it returns `true`, it will display that feature as if it was being hovered.

For this example, we'll load some 2022 5-year ACS data from Cleveland, Ohio that contains the share of workers who commute to work by bicycle.

```javascript
import topojson from "topojson-client";
import cleveland_bike_data_topo from "./path/top/topojson/cleveland_bike_to_work.json";
import { urbanColors } from "$lib/utils";
import { geoMercator, geoAlbersUsa } from "d3-geo";
import { scaleQuantize, scaleQuantile, scaleLinear } from "d3-scale";
import { extent, max } from "d3-array";

const cleveland_bike_data = topojson.feature(cleveland_bike_data_topo, "cleveland_bike_to_work");
const clevelandBikeScale = scaleQuantize()
    .domain(extent(cleveland_bike_data.features, (d) => d.properties.bike_to_work))
    .range(urbanColors.getMapBlues());
let clevelandHighlight = "39035197700";
```
<Canvas of={Stories.FeatureHighlight} sourceState="shown" />
