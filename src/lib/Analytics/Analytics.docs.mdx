# Analytics

A component that adds Urban Institute's Google Analytics to your page. This will enable tracking of page views and custom events in your project.

## Properties

The `Analytics` component has the following properties.

<Controls />

## Usage

By default, this will add Google analytics' `gtag` to your page and fire a page view. If you are using Urban Institute's dataviz project template, you'll likely want to include this in your `+layout.svelte` or on your `+page.svelte` routes.

<Source dark code={`
<script>
import { Analytics } from "@urban-institute/dataviz-components";
</script>
<Analytics title="My project title" />
`} language="html"/>

If you'd like to avoid firing a pageview because you're creating an en embed or for any other reason, you can do so by setting `sendPageview` to `false`.

<Source dark code={`
<script>
import { Analytics } from "@urban-institute/dataviz-components";
</script>
<Analytics title="My project title" sendPageview={false}/>
`} language="html"/>

Anytime you have an event handler, use this one-line function call to send relevant data through to Google Analytics:

<Source dark code={`
import { logClickToGA } from "@urban-institute/dataviz-components";

/**
 * sends event data to GTM and GA. call in event handlers for each event type you wish to track.
 * A function that logs a click event to Google Analytics.
 * @param {HTMLElement} target The DOM element that triggered the event.
 * @param {string} eventName A string in the format "event_name--event_specifics" where "event_name is the type of event, such as "map_click" or "dropdown_select" and "event_specifics" refers to the selected option, region, or specific function.
 */
logClickToGA(target, eventName);
`} language="js"/>

An example of logClickToGA in action:

<Source dark code={`
import { logClickToGA } from "@urban-institute/dataviz-components";

myElement.addEventListener("click", (e) => {
  logClickToGA(
    e.target,
    "map_click--" + e.detail.hoverData.hoverCounty + ", " + e.detail.hoverData.hoverStateName
  );
});
`} language="js"/>
