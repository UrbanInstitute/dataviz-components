# prefers-reduced-motion Svelte Store

[![github](https://badgen.net/badge/icon/GitHub?icon=github&label)](https://github.com/UrbanInstitute/dataviz-components/blob/main/src/lib/stores/reducedMotion.js)

A Svelte store that tracks the user's preference for reduced motion, adapted from [Geoff Rich's Accessible Svelte Transitions article](https://geoffrich.net/posts/accessible-svelte-transitions/).

Sometimes users may turn on "prefers-reduced-motion" in their accessibility settings. If this is this is the case, they expect to see no animations or transitions. This store uses `window.matchMedia()` to track the user's preference for reduced motion and can be used for conditional rendering.

## Usage

In the example below, the tweened store can be used to animate a component position. If the user has reduced motion enabled, the animation duration is reduced to 0.

```js
import { reducedMotion } from "@urbaninstitute/dataviz-components/stores";
import { tweened } from "svelte/motion";

const tween = tweened(0, {
  duration: $reducedMotion ? 0 : 500,
  easing: cubicOut
});
```

## Additional CSS for prefers-reduced-motion

It's worth noting that CSS like the following will disable most native Svelte transitions and animations. The `$reducedMotion` store above is useful if an animation function is not covered by this media query.

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  * {
    animation-delay: 0ms !important;
    animation-duration: 1ms !important;
    transition: none !important;
  }
}
```
